            When I was nine, my mom was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer
            and underwent a double mastectomy and oopherectomy in prevention of
            developing further disease. I watched as her body rejected the
            reconstructive surgery from the mastectomy only to shortly after
            develop metastatic breast cancer when I was thirteen. Despite seeing
            the promise in future medical studies and clinical trials, the
            cancer returned and consumed her 45-year-old healthy body,
            overtaking her liver and bones, eventually leaving me without a
            mother at the age of fifteen. When I was twenty, I made the the
            complicated decision to go through with genetic testing. I carry the
            gene that killed my mother. I can't start preventative testing until
            I am 25 but will never be able to talk to my mother about how to
            fight against the threat of the killer disease that left me an
            orphan.

            Through my work I visualize the things I have lost and things I will
            never experience. The wooden forms increase in size showing the
            mounting anxiety I have about outliving my mom, reaching the age of
            forty-six, crossing an imaginary barrier that most take for granted.
            A timeline of my life - with the space in between as an area to
            breathe; viewers can walk around, beside, or through the
            installation. There is a contrast between the abstract, pink forms
            and the nature and architecture around it. The viewer's experience
            shifts, altered by the sounds of traffic, construction, pedestrians
            walking by - mirroring the way life continues around us no matter
            how overwhelming grief and personal circumstances may seem. Both an
            homage to my personal grief and a memorial to my mother, the
            audience is encouraged to imprint their own understanding and
            processing onto the piece.

          03/05/2047 is located on the Southeast lawn of the Frick Fine Arts
          Building between the building and the field. It can be found at 650
          Schenly Drive Pittsburgh PA, 15213. From the senior exhibition,
          Detour, in the University Art Gallery, visitors should walk back
          towards the front entrance of Frick Fine Arts, exit the set of doors
          on the left and take the left hand staircase down towards the
          fountain. At the base of the stairs guests can turn left towards the
          Mazeroski Field and see the installation in between the rows of trees
          on the side of the building.

          When I think of my mom I can hear her laughter ringing through the
          room. I can see her smile light up her entire face as her joy and
          light radiates to everyone around her. She would share her love of
          music with me, dancing to so many different songs. When we would go to
          the beach she would be tanning on the sand, reluctantly coming into
          the water with a loud groan after my dad would beg her to join my
          brother and I in the waves. She would be the loudest parent at all of
          my brother and my sporting events, even if we were embarrassed by the
          cheering. I remember my mom as the brightest light, always spreading
          positivity and love and providing endless support to everyone she met.
          She was such a strong woman, showing me how to stand up for myself,
          fight for myself and for those I love, and to never give up even when
          everything seems impossible. Though I only got fifteen years with my
          mom, her legacy lives on through those she loved, and those who loved
          her, the stories we share, and the light we spread to others.
